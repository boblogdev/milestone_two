# Milestone Project 2

For my milestone project, I have chosen to create a quiz game focused on Stargate SG1 TV Series. 

I plan to utilize the knowledge and experience gained from Milestone 1, which involved HTML/CSS and Bootstrap, to construct this project. In addition, I will build upon this foundation by incorporating JavaScript, thereby demonstrating my proficiency in this particular area of study.
